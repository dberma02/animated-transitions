# Animated Transitions
Animated transitions between data visualizations in processing.js. 
Specific transitions include: 
- line graph to bar graph
- bar graph to line chart
- bar graph to pie chart
- pie chart to bar graph

Designed transitions in order to preserve the significant aspects of each data visualization throughout the animation.

To run, (install if necessary) and open processing.js and run the file 'animatedTransitions.pde'
